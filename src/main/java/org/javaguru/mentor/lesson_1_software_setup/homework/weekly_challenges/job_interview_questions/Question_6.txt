What is IDE - Integrated Development Environment?

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application
that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.
An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools
and a debugger.

The boundary between an IDE and other parts of the broader software
development environment is not well-defined; sometimes a version control
system or various tools to simplify the construction of a graphical user
interface (GUI) are integrated. Many modern IDEs also have a class browser,
an object browser, and a class hierarchy diagram for use in object-oriented
software development.

Syntax highlighting
The IDE editor usually provides syntax highlighting, it can show both the structures,
the language keywords and the syntax errors with visually distinct colors and font effects.

Code completion is an important IDE feature, intended to speed up
programming. Modern IDEs even have intelligent code completion.

Refactoring
Advanced IDEs provide support for automated refactoring.

Version control
An IDE is expected to provide integrated version control,
in order to interact with source repositories.

Debugging
IDEs are also used for debugging, using an integrated debugger,
with support for setting breakpoints in the editor, visual rendering of steps, etc.

Code search
IDEs may provide advanced support for code search:
in order to find class and function declarations,
usages, variable and field read/write, etc.
IDEs can use different kinds of user interface for code search,
for example form-based widgets[5] and natural-language based interfaces.
